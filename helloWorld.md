# Hello, World

The beginning of a project for me, particularly a greenfield project where no legacy code exists, is both exciting and terrifying. The sense of potential and possibility is almost intoxicating and for those of us who have with a deep-seated need to control and perfect the code we work on, a blank page also represents code with no errors in it yet.

The more you write, the more complex the software becomes and at some point you look at what you've written and realize that endless perfect potential has turned into legacy code that needs to be maintained. The sense of accomplishment is inevitably married to the realization that now you want to refactor everything.

Which is why sometimes it's hard to get started. The sense of impending failure and disappointment can often stop me and send me instead to playing Zelda on my Nintento, making excuses or procrastinating. Playing Zelda is a whole lot easier than accepting the inevitable messiness that is real life. 

So small, simple formal beginnings can be quite useful in solving that problem. In particular in situations where I am intimidated by the problem that I've set for myself or overwhelmed by it's complexity, this provides a clear open door to walk through.

```
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
  System.out.println("Hello, World");
}
``` 

The uses of a simple "Hello, World" start are many:

* It's a simple entry point to get started
* It also proves that I set up my java development environment correctly
